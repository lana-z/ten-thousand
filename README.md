### Log

- Sun: reviewed project requirements, set up files, initial prompts and code, tests passing
- Tues: added new testing files JB added to repo - 24 failing and 38 passing 
- Wed: solved for passing new calculation tests, except for 3 pairs, replaced correct score for 3 pairs to pass all Version_1 tests, collaborated with Kaitlyn to plan for lab 07, wrote game logic code based on simulations provided in Version_2 test folder. 
    - made it to bank_one_roll_then_quit sim, and it works, but other combinations of user choice do not work, and some score calculations are wrong
        - noting here to change later this week
        - pair of 1s score as 200 - is this supposed to be 1000 ?
